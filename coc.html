    <p id="parallel-info">Parallel combination of cell is a combination of cell in which the positive terminals of all cells are connected at one point and the negative terminals of all cels are connected at another point. Here, the electric current and emf do not change with change of numbers of cells. This lasts for a very long time but isn't that bright.</p>

    <h1>Series Cell Combination</h1>
    <img id="series-bulb" src="bulb.png" alt="Series Bulb">
    <p id="series-info">Series combination of cell is a combination of cell in which the positive terminal of the first cell is connected with the negative terminal of another cell and so on. These do not last for a long time but they are relatively bright compared to parallel combination of cells.</p>
